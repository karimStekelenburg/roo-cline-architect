# Visual Studio Code: Roo-Cline Architect Extension

## Overview
An extension that enhances Roo-Cline's capabilities in Visual Studio Code by formalizing and streamlining architectural design workflows for complex software projects.

## Background
Roo-Cline currently provides AI-powered coding assistance through Large Language Models like Claude Sonnet. While powerful for implementation tasks, complex projects benefit from a structured design-first approach before implementation.

## Interface Design

![Wireframe for VSCode Extension](wireframe.svg)

### User Interface Components

The extension's interface is designed to integrate seamlessly with Visual Studio Code's existing layout while providing specialized tools for architectural design. The interface follows VS Code's native dark theme and design patterns to maintain a consistent user experience.

The main interface consists of three primary regions: the Document Explorer Panel on the left, the Main Editor in the center, and the Preview Panel on the right. This layout optimizes the workflow for document creation and review while maintaining easy access to project context and resources.

Let's examine each component in detail:

#### Document Explorer Panel
Located on the left side of the interface, the Document Explorer serves as the primary navigation hub for all design documents. The panel presents a clear hierarchical view of project documentation, with each document's status immediately visible through color-coded indicators:

- Green circle with checkmark: Indicates an approved document that has been locked for the next phase
- Blue circle with dots: Shows a document currently in progress or under review
- Gray circle with dash: Represents a pending document that hasn't been started yet

This visual system allows team members to quickly assess the project's progress and identify which documents require attention.

#### Context Library Panel
Positioned below the Document Explorer, the Context Library provides quick access to reusable design elements and project context. The panel features:

- A searchable interface with filtering capabilities
- Collapsible categories for different types of context (architectural patterns, coding standards, configuration templates)
- Drag-and-drop functionality for seamless integration with documents
- Integration with project-specific settings and global templates

The Context Library helps maintain consistency across documents and reduces repetitive work by making commonly used elements easily accessible.

#### Main Editor Area
The central workspace is divided into two synchronized panels that work together to provide a comprehensive editing experience:

Left Panel (Editor):
- Full-featured Markdown editor with syntax highlighting
- Code completion for technical content
- Integrated AI assistance through Roo-Cline
- Support for diagram syntax (Mermaid, PlantUML)

Right Panel (Preview):
- Real-time rendering of Markdown content
- Live diagram previews
- Interactive elements for testing and validation
- Contextual feedback from Roo-Cline

#### Document Controls
The interface includes several control elements strategically placed for efficient workflow management:

- Approval/Rejection buttons at the bottom of the preview panel
- Version control integration in the top bar
- Document status toggles
- Export and sharing options
- Quick access to Roo-Cline assistance

This layout prioritizes efficiency and clarity, allowing developers to focus on document creation while maintaining easy access to all necessary tools and resources. The interface design supports the natural flow of the architectural design process, from initial conception through approval and implementation.
