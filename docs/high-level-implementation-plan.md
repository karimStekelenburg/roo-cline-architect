## Dependencies and Considerations

### Technical Dependencies
- VSCode Extension API
- Roo-Cline API Integration
- Git Integration APIs
- Markdown Processing Libraries
- Diagram Rendering Libraries

### Critical Path Items
1. Core extension infrastructure must be completed first
2. Document management system is required for context library
3. Editor system is needed for AI integration
4. Workflow system depends on document management
5. Git integration builds on workflow system

### Risk Factors
- Roo-Cline API integration complexity
- Real-time collaboration challenges
- Performance with large documents
- Git integration edge cases
- Extension marketplace requirements

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Epic 1: Core Extension Infrastructure
2. Create detailed technical specifications for each epic
3. Set up development environment and tooling
4. Establish testing framework
5. Begin sprint planning for Epic 1
