1. Always use TypeScript
2. Always use the bun package manager
3. Always start by reading all files in the /docs directory
4. When working on an epic, sprint, or user story, adhere to the following instructions meticulously
   1. **Branch Creation:**
      - Before commencing work on epics or sprints, create a new branch.
      - For an epic, branch from the main.
      - For a sprint, branch from the corresponding epic branch.

   2. **Pull Requests:**
      - Upon completing an epic or sprint, create a pull request using the GitHub CLI (gh).
      - Continue working by branching off the branch with an open pull request. This allows ongoing work while awaiting approval or merging of the pull requests.

   3. **User Stories:**
      - Create a new branch for each user story.
      - Merge these branches into their corresponding sprint branches when the work is complete.

   4. **Commit Practices:**
      - Always rebase; do not create merge commits.
      - Use conventional commits for commit messages.
      - Include references to identifiers for the sprint, epic, or user story in commit messages.

    Essentially a git-flow workflow.
5. When finishing an epic or sprint, always update docs/progress.md
